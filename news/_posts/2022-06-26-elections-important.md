## Class Dues

Remember to [make your $25 class dues payment](../../../dues/) today!

## Class Elections

Elections are open through July 8, 2022 for the four elected positions (President, Vice-President, Secretary, and Treasurer) through our 25th Reunion.

We are taking advantage of Election Runner voting software provided by the University that ensures that each classmate gets one vote. Your vote is anonymous! You should have received a personalized ballot from Election Runner via email containing your unique voter ID.

If you did not receive your ballot, check your spam/junk folder first for a message dated June 26. Please email Krista Dobi (kcdobi @ alumni) with questions regarding the elections process or if you did not receive a ballot.

## Soliciting Volunteers

If you are interested in other officer, volunteer, or Reunions committee positions, please fill out [this Google form](https://forms.gle/7N1Nf5uVxRmhRKVy7). Please email Krista with any questions regarding the form.

## Email communication issues

We believe a significant number of classmates are not receiving the broadcast emails sent through the new University system. Recent broadcast emails were sent on May 15, May 31, and June 16. If you did not receive all 3 of these messages, please consider emailng the TigerNet help desk at tigernet@princeton.edu and ccâ€™ing Class VP Aparna Kesarwala (kesarwla @ alumni). Please email Aparna with any other questions regarding class communications.

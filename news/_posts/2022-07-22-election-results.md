 We are recruiting for multiple class leadership roles, including web manager, social media/communications, community service, historian/memorialist, Reunions chair, and Reunions committee. If you are interested in serving the class in any capacity, please fill out the following [Google form](https://forms.gle/7N1Nf5uVxRmhRKVy7) or email the officers. Please email Krista (kcdobi at alumni) with any questions regarding the form or the officers regarding any of the roles.
 
 # 3) Class-wide Communications
 
 We continue to have significant communications issues, especially with TigerNet.
 ***PLEASE CONTINUE TO FOLLOW [THIS DOCUMENT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10bjk3-zcjDmVz4BF5p39C6SmzZnhkt-3GZ8MVhIbL6w/edit) FOR ALL CLASS UPDATES.***
 Emails: _We believe a significant number of classmates are not receiving these broadcast email messages and are having issues with @alumni accounts._ 
 
 We continue to work with TigerNet but do not know when this issue will be resolved. 
 
 If you are reading this and have not been receiving broadcast emails, or know of classmates that did not receive them, please email TigerNet (tigernet at princeton dot edu) and cc Class VP Aparna Kesarwala (kesarwla at alumni).
 Website: We do not currently have the ability to update our class website.
 
 # 4) Class Dues
 
 The loss of our 20th Reunion had a significant financial impact on our class. Class dues will be critical for the next several years as we will need money for deposits prior to our 25th Reunion. Annual dues are only $25 and you can pay [here](../../dues/index.html). Please email Class Treasurer Jeff Knapp (jdknapp at alumni) with questions.

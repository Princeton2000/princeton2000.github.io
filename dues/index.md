## Class Dues


The current dues rate is $25.

The loss of our 20th Reunion had a significant financial impact on our class. Class dues will be critical for the next several years as we will need money for deposits prior to our 25th Reunion.

Payment processing is handled by PayPal, but you do not need an account to complete the transaction. Payments can be made with all major credit cards, a bank account, or through a PayPal account. Paying your dues online is protected by PayPal's security.

Class dues are a tax-deductible contribution.  Thanks for your support!

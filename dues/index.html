	  <p>The current dues rate is $25.</p>
	  
	  <p>The loss of our 20th Reunion had a significant financial impact on our class. Class dues will be critical for the next several years as we will need money for deposits prior to our 25th Reunion.</p>
	  
	  <p>Payment processing is handled by PayPal, but you do not need an account to complete the transaction. Payments can be made with all major credit cards, a bank account, or through a PayPal account. Paying your dues online is protected by PayPal's security.</p>
	  
	  <p>Click on the button below to complete the transaction. Dues will be attributed to you based on the information entered on the PayPal checkout page. Unfortunately, dues histories are unavailable.</p>
	  
	  <p>Class dues are a tax-deductible contribution.  Thanks for your support!</p>
